# CRUD REST API with NestJS, Docker, Swagger, and Prisma

Crafting a RESTful API with NestJS, Docker, Swagger, and Prisma by creating a delightful recipe management system to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing recipes.

## Technologies

To build this application, I will be leveraging the power of the following tools:
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/): A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): An open-source database toolkit that makes it easy to reason about your data and how you interact with it.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): A powerful, open source object-relational database system.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): An open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/): A tool for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types, classes, and modules to the language.

Each of these technologies plays a crucial role in creating a robust, scalable, and maintainable application.

## Development Environment

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Runtime Environment
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) - For containerizing database
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) - Code Editor
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) - Database
- [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/) - Node.js Framework

## What is NestJS?

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework that comes with a plethora of advantages, including a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI). This CLI simplifies the process of creating a new NestJS application, making it easy to start a new project anytime, anywhere.

One of the key benefits of NestJS is its rich set of built-in functionalities that significantly streamline the development process, making your life as a developer much easier.
